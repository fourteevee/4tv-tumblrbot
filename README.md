# 4tv-tumblrbot

4tv-tumblrbot was a collaborative project I embarked on with my close friend Dima, who goes by @smoqueen on Tumblr. The aim of this endeavor was straightforward yet silly: to develop a Tumblr bot powered by a machine-learning model. This bot would be specifically trained on the content from a particular Tumblr blog or a selected set of blogs, allowing it to mimic the style, tone, and thematic essence of the original posts. The project reflects our shared passion for posting online!



## Preparation with TumblThree

**Download and Install TumblThree:**

- Visit the official [TumblThree GitHub page](https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree) and download the latest version of the application.
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file and run the `TumblThree.exe` file to launch the application.

**Add Tumblr Blogs:**

- Copy the URLs of the Tumblr blogs you want to download.
- In TumblThree, enter the blogs into the field marked **Enter URL**, then hit enter.
- The blogs will be added to the list of blogs in the main interface.

**Configure Download Settings:**

- Click on a blog in the list to view its settings on the right panel.
- Choose which content types you want to download, including text posts, answers, and more. 

**Start Downloading:**

- Click the **Download** button (represented by a download icon) to begin downloading the selected blogs.
- The application will download all available posts from the blogs based on your configuration.



## Setup

#### 1. Move Text Post Files to the Data Folder

- Organize your text post files by moving them to the `./data` directory within the project. Ensure that all your post files are stored here for easy access by the software.

#### 2. Rename Text Post Files

- Rename each text post file following the format:

  ```
  blogname_typeofpost.txt
  ```

  For example:

  - If the blog name is "myblog" and the post is a "texts", rename it to `myblog_texts.txt`.

- **For Windows:**

  1. Activate the virtual environment by running:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

  2. Once activated, run any of the Python programs with:

     ```bash
     python {program}.py
     ```

- **For Linux:**

  1. Activate the virtual environment by running:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

  2. Once activated, run any of the Python programs with:

     ```bash
     python3 {program}.py
     ```



## Testing

1. **Configure the Settings**: 
   - Open the config file and fill in the required options. 
   - Leave the `model` field blank for now, as it will be completed later after model training is complete.

2. **Prepare Training Data**: 
   - Place your correctly formatted post files into the `./data/` directory.
   - Run the script `create_training_data.py` to generate the necessary training data.

3. **Upload Training Data**: 
   - Once the training files are generated, locate them in the `./output/` folder.
   - Upload these files to OpenAI's fine-tuning web portal.
   - **Ensure you select the most recent version of the `gpt-4o-mini` model** for the fine-tuning process.

4. **Update the Config File**: 
   - After the fine-tuning process is complete, copy the model identifier from OpenAI’s web portal.
   - Paste the model identifier into the `model` field of your config file.

5. **Test the Model**: 
   - Run the script `4tv_tumblrbot.py` to generate posts. These posts will be saved in your Tumblr drafts.
   - Review the output in your drafts. If needed, repeat the process with different blogs or make adjustments to the training data to improve the model.



## Deployment

### Linux Instructions

1. **Place Your Python Script and Virtual Environment**

   - Ensure `4tv_tumblrbot.py` and the virtual environment (`.venv/`) are located in `/home/user/4tv-tumblrbot-1.0/`.

2. **Create a Shell Script to Run the Python Script**

   - Create a shell script named `run_4tv_tumblrbot.sh` in the same directory:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /home/user/4tv-tumblrbot-1.0/
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python 4tv_tumblrbot.py
   deactivate
   ```

3. **Make the Shell Script Executable**

   - Run the following command to make the shell script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/user/4tv-tumblrbot-1.0/run_4tv_tumblrbot.sh
   ```

4. **Schedule the Script Using Cron**

   - Open the cron table:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   - Add the following line to schedule the script to run daily at 2 AM:

   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /home/user/4tv-tumblrbot-1.0/run_4tv_tumblrbot.sh >> /home/user/4tv-tumblrbot-1.0/output.log 2>&1
   ```

   - This will log the output to `output.log` in the script's directory.

5. **Verify the Cron Job**

   - List your cron jobs to ensure it was added correctly:

   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

### Windows Instructions

1. **Place Your Python Script and Virtual Environment**

   - Ensure `4tv_tumblrbot.py` and the virtual environment (`.venv/`) are located in `C:\Users\user\4tv-tumblrbot-1.0\`.

2. **Create a Batch File to Run the Python Script**

   - Create a batch file named `run_4tv_tumblrbot.bat` in the same directory:

   ```batch
   @echo off
   cd C:\Users\user\4tv-tumblrbot-1.0\
   call .venv\Scripts\activate
   python 4tv_tumblrbot.py
   call .venv\Scripts\deactivate
   ```

3. **Schedule the Script Using Task Scheduler**

   - Open **Task Scheduler** by searching for it in the Start Menu.
   - Click **Create Basic Task** and name your task (e.g., “Run 4tv Tumblrbot Daily”).
   - Set the trigger to "Daily" and select the time (e.g., 2:00 AM).
   - Choose "Start a program" as the action.
   - In the **Program/script** field, enter the path to the batch file (`C:\Users\user\4tv-tumblrbot-1.0\run_4tv_tumblrbot.bat`).
   - Click **Finish** to create the task.

4. **Verify the Task**

   - Check the **Task Scheduler Library** to confirm your task is listed.
   - Optionally, run the task manually to ensure it works by right-clicking the task and selecting **Run**.

### Additional Notes:

- Make sure Python and the virtual environment are properly set up on both systems.
- Adjust paths and timings according to your preferences and system configurations.
- Ensure the script and virtual environment have appropriate permissions and configurations to run correctly.
